# About the project
This was originally a project I made in my free time to clone a The Sims styled gameplay.
However, due to the scope of the project requiring artistic skills I did not have at the time, it was abandoned.
Nowadays, however, it it's an important part of my portfolio as it shows not only I can develop in Unity, but I
can also code systems in Unity.

The game currently has a GameManager, a loading screen coded in, with it's own system used to pack and unpack
files from a custom .bank / zip-style format originally inteded to keep core .lua files for the game from being
modified by unaware modders and users. The game's core aspects would've been hardcoded into Unity, while the
rest of the gameplay would've been left to Lua to decide, and thus also allow for easy modification of the game.
This was done using MoonSharp libraries.
